# Design Manual

The Design Manual helps to shape our online presence by offering a set of guidelines which we work towards.

We generally use the Co-op Group Design Manual, however there are some parts of this which aren't applicable and also some areas which are not covered.

The purpose of this repository is to provide us with a central hub for our work, to enhance our owen unique guidelines and to eventually feed them into the Group Design Manual.
