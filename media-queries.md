## Media Queries

We currently use media queries based on device widths to determine which CSS rules are applied/ignored accordingly. Below are the list of thresholds we are working towards.

* 320px - mobile *(portrait)*
* 480px - mobile *(landscape)*
* 769px - tablet
* 990px - desktop
* 1300px - wide desktop *(not currently used)*

### CSS classes

The following are the CSS classes used for bootstrap, with **n** being replaced by a number (up to 12).

* col-md-**n** - Desktop
* col-sm-**n** - Tablet (up to 990px)
* col-xs-**n** - Mobile (up to 768px)
